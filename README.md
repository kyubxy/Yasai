# Yasai
my 48672094th attempt at making a multipurpose graphics engine from scratch.

## What did I change this time?/What did I learn from previous attempts?
- Engine data structures and API are decoupled from GPU calls wherever possible
- Behaviour and state decoupling in low-level areas of the code 
- Simplicity everywhere
- Build with applications in mind first, no more weird osu!framework fanboying
- Mostly flat file structure, using directories only for groups of classes that are expected to scale
- Class composition over inheritence, always aiming for a wide inheritence tree over a tall one.
- A general awareness and avoidance for any obvious code smells
- No relative positioning! It's too hard and contributes nothing to the quality of the engine.
- No unweildy scope, I want graphics, input, audio and resource caching. Nothing else.

## Why?
I like finishing things I start.

## Contribution
No. This is a personal project and I will not be taking PRs unless they're really small.
